# Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) calculation and test in public data (openSNPs)
Jupyter notebook explaining the fundamentals of genome wide association studies (GWAS) and the basis of polygenic risk score, as well as the context of its usage for the general people according to the crescent number of companies offering DNA based analysis for ancestrality and health purposes.

This notebook covers:
    1. PRS and GWAS explanation
    2. Preparation of the scoring files of powerful gwas studies
    3. Presentation of the public genotype dabatase OpenSNPs and detailed explanation of its data acquirement
    4. The implementation of the PRS mathematical formula uniting the data gathered in topics 2 and 3.
    5. Some initial analysis of the PRS scores calculated for the samples data obtained in topic 3
    6. Integration and exploration of the NCBI SNPs database according to the SNPs observed in the samples.
